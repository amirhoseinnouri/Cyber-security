README - Simple File Encryption Tool
🔐 Project Description
A basic C++ command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files using XOR cipher. This project demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts like file encryption, data confidentiality, and symmetric-key cryptography.

⚠️ Note: XOR encryption is simple but not secure for real-world use. This is for educational purposes only. For actual security, use strong encryption like AES.

🚀 Features
Encrypt any file (text, images, binaries, etc.)

Decrypt files using the same key

Simple command-line interface

Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

📝 Usage
Choose an option:

1 → Encrypt a file

2 → Decrypt a file

Enter the input filename (e.g., secret.txt)

Enter the output filename (e.g., encrypted_secret.txt)

Enter a secret key (remember it for decryption!)

Example:

1. Encrypt File  
2. Decrypt File  
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1  
Enter input filename: secret.txt  
Enter output filename: encrypted_secret.txt  
Enter encryption key: MyStrongPassword123  
File encrypted successfully!  
⚠️ Important Notes
The same key must be used for decryption.

Do not lose the key – without it, the file cannot be recovered!

XOR is weak encryption – for real security, use AES (via libraries like OpenSSL).

📌 Possible Improvements
✅ Add stronger encryption (AES, RSA)
✅ Implement password hashing (SHA-256)
✅ Add file integrity checks (HMAC)
✅ Support large files efficiently
✅ Add a GUI (Qt, GTK, or web-based)
